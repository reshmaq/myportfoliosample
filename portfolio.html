            <h2>About Me</h2><br>
            <p>Hello! I'm Reshma A, a passionate and driven software developer with over two years of experience in the tech industry. I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) degree in Computer Science in the year 2020, achieving a commendable CGPA of 7.27.</p><br><br>
<b>My Journey into DevOps:</b><br>

<p>My journey into the world of DevOps began with a curiosity to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. It was during my academic years that I realized the immense potential of DevOps in streamlining software delivery, enhancing collaboration, and ensuring the reliability and scalability of applications.

Driven by this fascination, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and skill acquisition. I dived deep into the world of DevOps, immersing myself in learning and hands-on exploration. I delved into a wide range of tools and technologies, including Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, Git, and AWS, among others.</p><br><br>
<b>My Vision:</b><br>
<p>My vision as a DevOps enthusiast is to contribute to the dynamic landscape of software development and operations by applying modern DevOps practices and principles. I believe that the synergy between development and operations is at the heart of successful software delivery. Through continuous learning and innovation, I aspire to play a vital role in optimizing processes, automating workflows, and ensuring the seamless deployment of applications.</p><br><br>
<b>Why DevOps?</b><br>
<p>DevOps, for me, is not just a set of tools and practices but a mindset that fosters collaboration, innovation, and agility. It's about breaking down silos, automating repetitive tasks, and delivering value to end-users faster and with higher quality. I am excited about the transformative power of DevOps and how it can reshape the software development landscape.

In my spare time, I continue to explore new technologies, participate in open-source projects, and seek opportunities for growth and contribution within the DevOps community.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to sharing my experiences and insights with you as I continue to explore and embrace the exciting world of DevOps.</p>

                <h3>Implemented Three Tier Architecture — AWS</h3>
                <p>Implemented a three tier Architecture that is highly available
 And scalable using Terraform and deployed  the application
 On Ec2  Instances using the User Data script.
<br>
 <i>AWS Components Involved:</i>
 VPC, ASG, Route53, CDN, ELB, EC2, S3, NAT, API Gateway.</p>

                <h3>Cloud Cost Optimization — AWS
</h3>
                <p>Used the combination of AWS cloud watch and Lambda functions
 To decrease the cloud cost by 25 percent.
<br>
 <i>Implementation:</i>
 Created lambda function in python, used the boto3 module to interact
 With AWS service APIs and this lambda function is triggered by
 Cloud Watch events.
 This lambda function would watch for any unused EBS snapshots and
 Either delete them or send out notification to the snapshot owner.</p>
